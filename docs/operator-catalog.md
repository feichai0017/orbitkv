# LLM Inference Operator Catalog

Loom Kernels aims to cover the common operator surface of production LLM
inference, but it is not a general tensor framework. An operator belongs here
when an inference engine needs a stable backend boundary, or when fusion,
layout knowledge, quantization, or launch reduction can improve a measured
workload.

The catalog deliberately does not promise handwritten replacements for every
pointwise expression. Dense, quantized, sparse, and grouped GEMM always use
cuBLASLt, CUTLASS, FlashInfer, or an engine-selected vendor implementation.
Loom owns only memory-bound preparation, movement, fusion, and epilogues around
that matrix core.

Catalog admission requires a memory/layout/scheduling bottleneck, a named
engine gap, and a real model or serving exit gate. A plausible CUDA kernel or
isolated microbenchmark is not sufficient.

## Status Legend

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| supported | contract, oracle, CUDA, framework adapter, and H20 evidence exist |
| in progress | source path exists, but required hardware or engine evidence is still open |
| next | admitted to the immediate implementation queue |
| planned | useful surface with a named engine consumer, ordered after `next` |
| profile-gated | implemented only when a real workload shows material cost |
| vendor-backed | the engine/vendor owns the base primitive; Loom may expose only an adjacent memory-bound boundary |

Collectives will wrap NCCL or another qualified transport. Loom will not claim
a distributed speedup from a same-process adapter or from a local kernel alone.

## Layout And Internal Primitives

Cast, transpose, concatenate/split, pad/unpad, gather/scatter, reductions,
prefix sums, packing, and block copies are profile-gated. They may be shared
internal building blocks, but become public operators only when an engine needs
the boundary or an isolated implementation is measurably useful.

## Implementation Order

1. Finish H20 and clean-wheel qualification for the static FP8 E4M3
   quantize-on-write path, then prove cache bytes, admitted context/batch,
   quality, and TPOT together.
2. Complete the sampling tail with fused preprocessing, penalties, top-k/top-p,
   renormalization, deterministic RNG, and top-k logprobs.
3. Add KV block movement for a real prefix-cache, preemption, or compaction
   call site.
4. Return to tree metadata, stochastic speculative rejection, or KV
   commit/remap only when a named engine profile shows material cost. The
   current real-model gate puts verification below `0.2%` of batch latency.
5. Fill quantization scale/pack/layout gaps only around an unchanged vendor
   GEMM path.
6. Add MoE routing, histogram/prefix sum, permutation, and combine; grouped
   GEMM remains entirely engine/vendor-owned.
7. Build the engine-neutral Rust decode proof after one new feature reaches an
   engine.
8. Broaden paged decode or communication-aware fusion only when profiling and
   reproducible engine workloads justify it.

Every item advances independently through the admission gates in the
[operator-library design](design/operator-library.md). Catalog membership is a
product direction, not a performance or production-readiness claim.
