# Documentation

- [Operator library design](design/operator-library.md): architecture and
  admission gates.
- [LLM inference operator catalog](operator-catalog.md): complete intended
  common-operator surface, scope, priority, and current state.
- [Roadmap](roadmap.md): prioritized operator sequence and exit criteria.
- [Implementation status](status.md): what is implemented and validated now.
- [vLLM IR provider guide](guides/vllm-ir-provider.md): build, load, select,
  test, and benchmark the engine adapter.
- [H20 F32 RMSNorm report](results/h20-rms-norm-f32-smoke-20260721.json):
  hardware-qualified bring-up evidence.
- [H20 FP16/BF16 RMSNorm report](results/h20-rms-norm-low-precision-20260721.json):
  pair-vectorized and odd-size fallback evidence.
- [H20 fused Add+RMSNorm report](results/h20-add-rms-norm-20260721.json):
  double in-place, multi-dtype, and odd-size evidence.
- [H20 vLLM IR integration report](results/h20-vllm-ir-add-rms-norm-20260721.json):
  named baseline, PyTorch bridge, CUDA Graph, and engine-run evidence.
- [H20 RMSNorm+dynamic-FP8 report](results/h20-rms-norm-dynamic-fp8-20260721.json):
  multi-dtype bitwise compatibility, raw CUDA, and order-reversed vLLM evidence.
- [H20 SiLU-and-Mul report](results/h20-silu-and-mul-20260721.json):
  multi-dtype compatibility, graph parity, eager instability, and vLLM engine
  smoke evidence.
- [H20 SiLU-and-Mul+dynamic-block-FP8 report](results/h20-silu-and-mul-dynamic-fp8-20260721.json):
  exact fused-vLLM compatibility, raw CUDA, compiler-boundary, and
  order-reversed named-baseline evidence.

Only results under `docs/results` count as performance evidence. A CPU test, a
successful CUDA launch, or an isolated number without a named baseline is not a
speedup claim.
