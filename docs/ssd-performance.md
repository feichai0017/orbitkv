## Native SSD host restore batching (2026-10-07)

**Implemented; native median and installed-engine local gates pass; independent review open.**
Production commit `50c6d58d` groups immutable io_uring restore sources by SSD
store, with at most 16 unique keys per reader batch. Repeated layer references
share one generation; different generations of the same key remain in separate
batches. All reads reach terminal completion before any GPU source is replaced
or an error returns. Existing query, extent and destination ownership is retained.
The change reduces batch admission/completion work, not physical READV operations.
It is consumed by the managed SSD host-restore lane, including the explicit
`--ssd-read-path uring` demand route tested here. Default host-prefetch queries
keep their existing batch reader; this is not a claimed speedup for every SSD
lookup. It changes no GPU backend default, cache policy or readiness boundary.

A frozen baseline/candidate cohort uses complete CUDA 13 wheels on one A100 SM80,
with `O_DIRECT` files on the `/tmp` ext4 NVMe mount. Twelve cells cover five
shapes, each with 20 warm-ups and 100 measured restores; three independent pairs
reverse order. They include 4 KiB blocks and representative 36-layer split K/V
layouts of 9 and 108 MiB. These layouts are not a captured engine histogram.
The client timer wraps native `start_restore` through `wait_restore` return,
including Python call/return overhead, host SSD materialization and H2D. It is
not a GPU-only or instrumented Rust-only timer; preparation queries and byte
checks are outside.

All 15 per-shape paired median ratios pass the predeclared 1.05 guard; the largest
is 1.0154. Twelve-block 4 KiB restores use one reader batch instead of twelve,
with a geometric mean median ratio of 0.645. Thirty-four-block restores use three
batches instead of 34, with ratio 0.903. The 9 MiB layout stays near parity.
The 108 MiB median ratio is 0.971, but its descriptive pair-bootstrap interval
[0.947, 1.011] crosses parity, so a stable model-shaped improvement is not
established. Every measured destination is filled with a sentinel first and
compared byte-for-byte; physical SSD reads equal completed H2D bytes. Managers
exit zero and pinned/read/write ownership counters drain. These are client
restore measurements, not TTFT, ITL, throughput or device-bandwidth qualification.

Only three independent pairs are available per shape. All samples and pair
bootstrap intervals remain in the external analysis; p99 at 100 samples is
descriptive. One 34-block paired p99 rises from 0.738 to 2.486 ms (3.37x), and one
12-block pair rises from 0.639 to 1.101 ms (1.72x). These tails remain visible;
the median guard does not qualify tail performance or inference contention.
Earlier manifest/controller errors, asynchronous-write preparation failure and
temporary-file provenance loss are recorded separately. The final cohort uses
one corrected harness throughout and retains raw evidence in `/workspace`,
without mixing cells from older attempts. `/cache/sync` waits for insertion,
not asynchronous SSD writes; the benchmark waits for SSD write/query ownership
before evicting DRAM. SSD data uses the same ext4/NVMe mount via a separate fresh
`--ssd-cache-path`, which cannot overwrite an existing path.

Reproduce with a prebuilt installed wheel and a fresh external directory:

```bash
/path/to/release/python -m benches.communication \
  --manager /path/to/installed/orbitkv-cache-manager-py \
  --tier ssd --ssd-cache-path /mnt/nvme/orbitkv-bench/restore-001 \
  --layout split --layers 36 --block-bytes 262144 \
  --payload-bytes 262144 3145728 --iterations 100 --warmup 20 \
  --repeats 1 --idle-ms 0 --idle-seconds 0.1 \
  --output /var/tmp/orbitkv-ssd/restore-001
```

The benchmark forces io_uring and an SSD-only source for every restore. Its
Manager, extension, shared libraries, commands, mount, counters and byte oracles
are recorded. Use the same harness, budgets and workload for both wheels. Current
raw results and the promotion contract live outside Git at
`/root/orbitkv-artifacts/s5-ssd-host-batching-20261007/`, with the new A100
cohort at `/workspace/orbitkv-s5-ssd-host-batching-20261007/`. Evidence and
SSD payload paths are separate. The first passing cohort lost part of its
raw evidence during unexpected `/tmp` cleanup; its aggregate observations
and surviving files are retained, but do not qualify independent acceptance.

The complete CUDA 13 wheel `8acd6a06…` also passes three fresh official-engine
SSD gates on A100: vLLM 0.31.0 V1 and SGLang 0.5.21 ordinary cold/HBM/full/partial
cache flows, plus shared-Manager serving, engine restart and drained Manager
cold rebuild. Each full/partial restore loads 113,246,208 bytes; concurrent
external restore loads 226,492,416 bytes with matching physical io_uring reads
and four reader batches. All 20 services exit zero without forced cleanup;
installed engine/OrbitKV files are unchanged and GPU postflight is empty. These
functional gates use `direct`, dense Qwen3-8B TP=1/PP=1 eager, with cache files
on the `/workspace` overlay; they do not measure NVMe throughput or close
sustained contention, graphs, H20, native P/D faults or S3 crash reclamation.

## Physical READV merging evaluation (2026-10-08)

**Rejected; production retains the accepted scalar reader.** A bounded candidate
merged only already queued same-batch, same-file, logically and physically adjacent
leased extents, with no padding/gap reads. Its caps were 16 blocks, 32 MiB and
1,024 iovecs; logical in-flight credits and source ownership through CQE drain
were unchanged. A short READV failed every member of its group. The real
short-read/byte/lease gate and all 14 native SSD lifecycle tests passed.

Two complete CUDA 13 wheels shared the same READV counter, client extension,
TENT libraries, direct backend and harness. On A100 with ext4/NVMe, the first
matched pair used 20 warm-ups and 100 measured restores for each small shape.
Twelve 4 KiB blocks used one queued READV instead of 12, but median restore
latency rose 293.86 → 323.31 µs. Thirty-four blocks used three instead of 34,
but latency rose 533.68 → 665.01 µs. Both exceed the predeclared 5% guard;
no later qualification cells or installed-model promotion gates started.
These first-pair results reject this candidate; they are not a repeated system
regression estimate. All failed samples and candidate source are retained.

A separate four-cell diagnostic enables existing bounded cost observations,
with five warm-ups and 30 measured operations per shape. Every payload and
ownership drain passes. The 108 MiB scalar baseline averages 20.3 ms from SSD
prefetch enqueue through host materialization and 4.8 ms in direct H2D service.
The merged candidate supplies no demonstrated advantage. These overlapping
host boundaries locate further investigation; instrumentation overhead is
unqualified, and their means cannot be added to decompose a tail percentile.
The current read owner distributes scalar I/O over 15 read queues for one file;
merging reduces that active fanout. Lost parallelism and extra preparation work
remain hypotheses until bounded attribution separates them.

The production counter `orbitkv_ssd_uring_read_operations_total` distinguishes
queued READV SQEs from reader batches and physical device commands.
`benches.communication` persists existing stage snapshots before/after each
cohort, outside the measured request loop, and requires positive READV evidence
for new SSD experiments. It retains SSD prefetch duration alongside equal
stored/GPU bytes. Full contract, source, wheel hashes, rejection decisions,
raw timings and controls: `/root/orbitkv-artifacts/s4-readv-kda-20261008/`,
with the A100 mirror at `/workspace/orbitkv-perf-20261008/`.

## Reader thread fanout evaluation (2026-10-08)

**Rejected; the default remains 16 total io_uring threads.** The existing owner
already submits independent host-reader batches concurrently. A single-file
candidate reduces only read queues from 15 to seven, preserving scalar READV,
queue depth, byte budgets and completion ownership. All 14 real SSD tests and
completed cohort payload/read/drain controls pass.

The frozen three-pair, alternating-order A100/ext4-NVMe cohort stops at the third
small-shape pair: 12 and 34 blocks of 4 KiB regress from 291.776 to 511.521 µs
and from 542.133 to 864.261 µs. Both exceed the predeclared 5% median guard.
Earlier pairs cross parity, so this is a failed promotion test rather than an
estimate of a stable system-wide regression. Lower whole-cohort CPU ticks do
not authorize promotion. No final model pair or installed-engine promotion gate
starts. The candidate is reverted; source, complete wheels, raw samples and
controls remain at `/root/orbitkv-artifacts/s4-ssd-read-fanout-20261008/` and
`/workspace/orbitkv-ssd-fanout-20261008/`.

## Cross-host SSD read-batch component

The 2026-10-10 physical two-H20 comparison changes only consumer ordinary
read-batch admission from 32 to 128 MiB, using unchanged production `1ab67a58`,
official vLLM 0.31.0/SGLang 0.5.21, Qwen3-8B BF16 TP=1/PP=1 eager, equal
budgets and a source io_uring SSD. Remote TENT reads end in consumer DRAM before
local H2D; native GDS and remote GPU-buffer RDMA are outside this measurement.

The first SGLang cell passes all 50 restores but fails shutdown because the
external controller closes its source Manager before engine context unregister.
The frozen SGLang no-traceback guard correctly stops the campaign. The controller
labels ten preceding vLLM cells PASS, but raw logs reveal source unregister
tracebacks and one consumer `EngineDeadError`; their lifecycle is not accepted.
All 550 retained restores have exact output and payload bytes. Actual
authorization/READ counts fall from 3/6 to 1/2 for 72/144 MiB payloads, but the
complete comparison is invalid and a vLLM pair also exceeds its 5% TTFT guard.
Fewer calls do not establish a stable latency improvement. The 128 MiB setting
is not promoted and the default stays 32 MiB.

A separate CPU-only control reproduces the shutdown fault, checks engine
unregister before Manager shutdown and rejects worker shutdown errors. It does
not repair the consumer vLLM shutdown failure. A new, independently reviewed
bundle and cohort are required; neither a retry nor a replacement changes the
stopped campaign. Preserve failures and raw evidence at
`/root/orbitkv-artifacts/s5-ssd-peer-batch-20261010/`.
See [S5.5](completion-plan.md#s55--deployment-matrix-and-upstream-maintenance)
and [the comparison methodology](../benches/README.md#independent-ssd-read-batch-comparisons).

## Shared-Manager mixed-pressure qualification

`benches.shared_manager_pressure` runs installed official vLLM 0.31.0 and
SGLang 0.5.21 against one Manager. The fixed workload interleaves reused prefixes
with deterministic fresh prefixes, fixes each engine to 4,096 native GPU tokens
and caps client admission separately for each engine, compares every output and token count to its own native engine, and
finishes every admitted request before shutdown. A separate lightweight process
samples Manager resources once per second without loading Torch, CUDA or OrbitKV.
The gate requires a completion gap below 30 seconds while each engine has
admitted work, positive physical read/write and save/load bytes, final ownership
drain and normal cleanup. Configure
and report global and per-instance query limits separately. The admission owner
now retains exact global and maximum-single-instance reservation peaks since
Manager budget creation, including warm-up; the gate reads them after drain so
short reservations between sampler ticks are still covered. Pool peaks remain
sampled. The new installed wheel passes one 30-second A100 dense eager
two-engine boundary cell with all 87 exact native controls, both reservation
peaks within their limits and final ownership drain. This functional check is
pending independent review and does not qualify sustained pressure, fairness
or old frozen cells. Evidence: `/root/orbitkv-artifacts/s5-budget-peaks-20261008/`. No timed cache flush, restart, cache-policy change or
Python state coordinator is introduced.

Two short untraced direct cells pass 44 and 43 requests, physical io_uring reads
and writes, sampled bounds, final drain and unchanged installed files. They are
smoke/diagnostic evidence with descriptive tails. The sustained two-cell cohort
is **invalid at direct startup**, before any timed request: SGLang reports an
iceoryx2 discovery `DoesNotExist`. Its kernel cell is not started. A traced
kernel profile supplies actual save fragment sizes but cannot certify performance;
the intermittent discovery cause remains unresolved. Do not declare sustained
fairness, tail isolation, per-instance peak qualification or a kernel advantage.
All failures and diagnostics are retained outside Git at
`/root/orbitkv-artifacts/s5-shared-pressure-kda-20261007/`.

The later unchanged final wheel `fe427c42…` completes both 900-second H20
direct/kernel shared-Manager cells with exact native outputs, positive io_uring
read/write and GPU traffic, bounded reservation peaks and normal exit. Six
actual io_uring drain gauges are present and zero; inactive cuFile staging is
not misreported as measured zero. This correctness/progress profile is independently accepted; the overlay filesystem, different seeds and lack of matched
independent pairs establish neither physical NVMe nor inference performance.
Earlier invalid startups remain unresolved and preserved. Scope and full
evidence: [S5.5](completion-plan.md#s55--deployment-matrix-and-upstream-maintenance),
`/root/orbitkv-artifacts/s5-h20-closeout-20261008/`.

Reproduce only with a fresh output/data directory and an idle GPU. Record the
startup outcome before interpreting any latency sample:

```bash
/path/to/vllm-release/python -m benches.shared_manager_pressure \
  --vllm-python /path/to/vllm-release/python \
  --sglang-python /path/to/sglang-release/python \
  --model /path/to/immutable-model --transfer-backend direct \
  --duration-seconds 900 --seed sustained-01 \
  --ssd-path /mnt/nvme/orbitkv-bench/shared-pressure-001 \
  --output /var/tmp/orbitkv-ssd/shared-pressure-001
```

The defaults use 512 MiB Manager DRAM, 8 GiB io_uring SSD, 384 MiB global and
192 MiB configured per-instance query limits, 16 prefixes of 768 tokens per
engine, eight output tokens and one admitted request per engine. Every eighth
input is fresh. TTFT is client time to first nonempty streamed text; a debug `--profile` run
reports consumed descriptors separately from performance qualification. Keep
workload, budgets and order fixed in matched runs, retain
every sample, and report p99 as descriptive below 1,000 requests per engine.
Independent run pairs are required for a comparative performance claim. A failed
startup or correctness/drain/provenance guard stops its cohort; a revision needs
a new freeze rather than a replacement cell.

## Next SSD work and native GDS boundary

[LMCache's local disk design](https://docs.lmcache.ai/kv_cache/storage_backends/local_storage.html)
uses asynchronous writes and prioritizes prefetch over deletes and puts.
[FlexKV's current configuration reference](https://github.com/taco-project/FlexKV/blob/main/docs/flexkv_config_reference/README_en.md)
describes coalescing small scattered SSD I/O. These are design references inspected
on 2026-10-07, not matched performance controls or qualified OrbitKV behavior.
OrbitKV already has bounded read/write owners; extend those owners after measuring
mixed save/query pressure, per-instance progress and write admission.

Physical I/O merging is separate from host-reader batching. A future candidate
must use leased adjacent extents in the same file, bounded bytes/iovec counts,
correct short-read/error handling and validation for every generation. It must
avoid unrequested gaps, ring-wrap aliasing and extra CPU repacking. Multi-device
scaling needs actual device topology and matched budgets.

The existing cuFile path uses registered GPU staging before scatter/decode.
[NVIDIA's guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/best-practices-guide/index.html)
distinguishes small batch I/O from stream-ordered operations and recommends
reusing registered staging where registration can be amortized. It also notes
higher execution latency for small stream-ordered I/O. GDS is therefore a measured
route candidate, not an automatic speedup. Use [the native-path gate](gds.md)
with compatibility disabled and physical native I/O statistics; library presence
or successful initialization is insufficient. Direct engine-page I/O and new
scatter/checksum kernels remain unqualified follow-ups in S4.

## Historical concurrent inference evidence

The September 23, 2026 Qwen3-8B experiment keeps DRAM and SSD enabled together
and uses a working set larger than their in-memory capacity. It measures
request latency, transfer stages, bytes and cleanup under natural eviction.
The H20 development container exposes an `O_DIRECT`/io_uring cache file on an
overlay mount; these are application measurements, not a physical NVMe or PCIe
bandwidth limit.

## Workload and evidence

Both engines use the same BF16 model revision, TP=1, 64-token pages, concurrency
eight and 16 output tokens. Thirty-two alternating 4K/8K prefixes occupy a
nominal **27 GiB** of KV. The budgets are **9 GiB GPU KV, 4 GiB Manager DRAM,
64 GiB SSD and 3 GiB query reservations**. A request has a 75% chance of choosing
one of the prepared prefixes; other requests use fresh tokens. Choosing a
prefix does not guarantee a cache hit.

Each fresh service prepares its reference prefixes outside measurement,
admits requests for 60 seconds, then finishes every admitted request. The
10,000-request safety cap is not reached. No manual DRAM cleanup runs during
the window: reads and background writes compete while cold traffic adds new
state. Warming and owned preparation are off, read batching uses the default,
and transfer tracing is on. Throughput includes the admitted-request tail but
excludes initialization, reference preparation and the later resource-drain
check. It is not an arrival-rate SLO experiment.

The [final CSV](https://github.com/feichai0017/orbitkv/blob/9fe1441c0d7d4c47b1914c303f837bba9f4a758f/benches/results/20260923-offload/summary.csv) and
[reproduction instructions](https://github.com/feichai0017/orbitkv/blob/9fe1441c0d7d4c47b1914c303f837bba9f4a758f/benches/results/20260923-offload/README.md)
identify revisions, configuration and counters. Raw samples, manifests,
process-local timelines and service logs stay in external artifact directories.
The baseline uses vLLM 0.29.0 and SGLang 0.5.20 with the same engine releases
and model for every candidate run.

## Changes being measured

- vLLM records a CUDA event on the producing stream after the forward launch,
  outside CUDA graph capture. The save worker waits for its producer events;
  unrelated later GPU work no longer extends a device-wide synchronization.
  Source pages remain owned through the native D2H completion.
- Rust routes SSD reads across the existing read workers and reserves stable
  queues for writes. A read need not wait for a write's submission queue to
  drain. Thread count and in-flight I/O limits are unchanged.
- SSD-backed Managers allocate saved and restored page segments independently
  on their NUMA node. Read and write allocation sizes agree, and one surviving
  page cannot retain an unrelated multi-page batch. Page-first layouts already
  have one full page per stored segment. DRAM-only allocation keeps its existing
  batching option. The old multi-page staging planner and raw-pointer
  reconstruction helpers are removed.
- Total and speculative query reservations use independent counters updated
  under the admission lock. Phase-labelled samples remain diagnostic and
  must not be summed to enforce a budget: a scrape can overlap a transition.

The allocation change addresses a failure observed in the large-working-set
control: a 256 MiB allocation could fail with more than that much aggregate
pool space available. The retained-page GPU test checks both saved and
SSD-restored pages, with contiguous and split K/V layouts. It keeps one page
alive, verifies that eviction frees its three sibling pages, then restores the
held page and compares its exact GPU bytes.

## Final comparison

Milliseconds for TTFT; generated tokens per second for throughput.

[Full historical measurement table](https://github.com/feichai0017/orbitkv/blob/9fe1441c0d7d4c47b1914c303f837bba9f4a758f/docs/ssd-performance.md)

At the unchanged 8K prefill limit, vLLM throughput is essentially flat
(59.35 → 59.39); SGLang is 2.0% lower (59.01 → 57.83). SGLang P95 is
4.6% higher. These observations do not establish an overall throughput gain;
the retained control rows also show run-to-run tail variation. No speedup
claim or hardware-limit claim follows from this comparison.

All final configurations recorded zero pool-allocation and SSD-read failures.
The old vLLM allocation path recorded one failure in the baseline and six
in the queue/fence control. Independent reclamation has a deterministic GPU
gate; zero failures in a short workload do not prove that all capacity choices
can admit every save.

With 8K prefill, vLLM read **107.97 GiB** and wrote **47.21 GiB** through SSD;
SGLang read **100.76 GiB** and wrote **39.39 GiB**. These are window totals,
including the final drain. SGLang still dropped **625 blocks** from its SSD
write queue (baseline: 639), so write admission remains unfinished work.

For vLLM, 4K prefill lowers P95 by 15.3% while reducing throughput by 4.5%.
For SGLang it reduces throughput by 4.1% without improving P95. Keep 8K as the
benchmark default; a latency-oriented deployment can test vLLM's 4K option
against its own throughput target. The current 8K runs retain four vLLM
output differences and zero SGLang differences; 4K retains five and one
respectively. They remain visible in the CSV and require the separate
deterministic controls below.

## Interpreting the stages

`demand_prepare_ms` includes queued work, allocation, SSD reads and rebuilding.
`manager_restore_ms` includes dispatch, the GPU worker queue and synchronized
H2D work. In these recorded runs, `completion_delivery_ms` ran from the Manager's
completed GPU task until it answered the engine's terminal poll. The shared-memory
completion protocol has since removed that RPC and its metric; current reports
use the engine's `restore_ms` interval and Manager `completion_signal_ms`.
Reproduce the recorded reports with their original revision. These are
overlapping, process-local observations; adding their percentiles does not produce TTFT.
Dense lookup combines candidate discovery and preparation in this workload.

The initial queue/fence comparison, before page-granular staging, left both
engines near 59 output tokens/s. vLLM's completion-delivery P95 stayed near
0.94 seconds despite a Manager-restore P95 near 50 ms. The completion signal
itself took about 0.13 ms. This locates an exposed wait in engine consumption,
rather than establishing a slow notification transport or PCIe limit.

A separate 2K prefill diagnostic cut vLLM's delivery P95 to about 234 ms, but
reduced throughput from 59.2 to 56.0 output tokens/s. Shorter compute quanta
can improve one stage while adding scheduling/compute overhead. The final
4K prefill rows are configuration controls; compare only the 8K rows when
attributing a change to OrbitKV code. Neither engine's default is changed.

## Correctness and operational limits

Performance runs use ordinary greedy inference and retain every output
mismatch from the serial prefix references. They do not enable deterministic
inference, so these counts neither prove cache corruption nor establish exact
output equivalence. Separate native GPU-byte checks and deterministic serving
E2E gates cover restoration correctness. Cancellation, lost notification,
stalled Publish and restart retain their page-lifetime gates.

The final implementation passes 164 Rust unit tests (one ignored), 13 native
SSD tests, 12 fault-lifetime tests and both engines' GPU-byte gates. Qwen3-8B
serving passes six vLLM cases and both SGLang DRAM/SSD cases; vLLM's HMA-only
case is skipped for this dense model. The producer-fence gate verifies exact
restored bytes while unrelated GPU work is still running.

The final candidate checks the independent total-query counter against 3 GiB
and the speculative counter against one quarter of that limit. Query, copy,
SSD-read and SSD-write activity must drain after requests finish. The explicit
drain interval includes a fixed 1.2-second settle; it is not a last-page-release
latency. Sampling every 25 ms can miss peaks, so ownership tests remain required.
The baseline's phase-summed peak is retained in a separate CSV column and is
not used as an exact budget observation.

The CSV also retains allocation failures, SSD read failures and write-queue
rejections. `orbitkv_ssd_write_queue_full_total` counts dropped **blocks**.
A completed D2H save confirms a DRAM replica; SSD writes are asynchronous and
may be dropped under pressure. A failed allocation can make a request
recompute. Neither outcome should disappear from a performance report.

This is one short window per final configuration, not a repeated tail-latency
qualification, a capacity soak or a competitor ranking. It does not show that
single-node offload has reached its limit. Repeat paired runs with order
reversal before selecting defaults. The remaining measured work is engine
completion/admission overlap, retention and SSD write admission under mixed
traffic, and physical-device scaling with a controlled storage mount. Keep
those changes separate from multi-host/RDMA qualification.

## Query-readiness follow-up

The September 21 SSD-readiness experiment remains a separate historical gate:
after forced DRAM eviction, both engines restored **15/15** requests from SSD,
with positive and matching SSD-read/H2D byte counts. At 8K, median TTFT was
244.47 ms for vLLM and 268.04 ms for SGLang, versus cold prefill near one second.
The old SGLang integration's 0/15 result predates readiness-aware admission.
See the [immutable experiment and its controls](https://github.com/feichai0017/orbitkv/blob/4712f780c900120719f178b2ea36c9e0ac7c135f/docs/ssd-performance.md).
These serial forced-eviction numbers must not be mixed with the concurrent
natural-pressure measurements above.
