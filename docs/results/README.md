providers.

## Results

The 2026-08-03 record qualifies the current owned-binding and fixed-address
Graph source projection. Earlier records remain immutable historical results.

- [Owned bindings and CUDA Graph H20 result](h20-owned-bindings-cuda-graph-correctness-20260803.json):
  RMSNorm and BF16 GEMM correctness pass. The final output after two fixed-address
  Graph replays matches the CPU fixture. Compute Sanitizer reports no errors or
  device leaks.

- [F32 RMSNorm H20 correctness](h20-rms-norm-f32-correctness-20260802.json):
  four shapes and exact buffer rejection pass on a non-default stream.
- [F32 RMSNorm H20 command scope](h20-rms-norm-f32-command-scope-20260802.json):
  checked bindings, queue reuse, two-command chaining, and a partial-scope
  rejection pass. The record contains no performance, graph, engine, or
  serving claim.
- [FP16 and BF16 RMSNorm H20 correctness](h20-rms-norm-low-precision-20260802.json):
  scalar and packed paths, typed heterogeneous bindings, short-buffer checks,
  signed zero, and reusable two-command scopes pass.
- [BF16 cuBLASLt GEMM H20 correctness](h20-bf16-cublaslt-correctness-20260802.json):
  fixed-plan standalone and transpose-sensitive cases, exact spans, command
  capacity, reuse, and RMSNorm-to-GEMM chaining pass. No performance claim is
  included.

## Claim levels

| Level | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Correctness | Declared contract, oracle, error limit, and edge cases |
| Lifecycle | Stream order, resource retention, capacity, reuse, and completion behavior |
| Kernel | Matched buffers, streams, provider order, and raw device timings |
| Graph | Capture and replay behavior with fixed plans and declared binding policy |
| Engine | Real invocation, provider hit count, and model output |
| Serving | TTFT, TPOT, throughput, memory, and workload definition |

## Record format

Each JSON record includes:

- source commit, lockfile hash, and clean-worktree state.
- hardware, driver, compiler, CUDA, and `cuda-oxide` versions.
- operator contract, shapes, dtypes, layouts, and tolerances.
- commands and artifact hashes.
- accepted and excluded claims.

Performance records also include raw timing samples, summary statistics, and
provider order.

Use `h20-<operator>-<gate>-YYYYMMDD.json` for H20 results. A result file is
immutable after review. A changed source, contract, toolchain, or provider
requires a new record.
