# Compatibility and distribution

Loom separates source compatibility, GPU validation, engine compatibility, and
binary portability. A green row below applies only to the stated boundary.

## Qualified matrix

| Component | Qualified version | Boundary | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust | current stable toolchain | format, Clippy, tests, release checks, source crate archives | GitHub CI |
| CUDA | 13.1, `sm_90` | `loom-cuda`, `loom-cuda-sys`, and `loom-cuda-bridge` build and execute | NVIDIA H20 gate |
| Python | 3.11.2 | clean native-wheel install; the `py3-none` artifact does not use the CPython C API | [native-wheel gate](results/h20-native-wheel-clean-install-20260723.json) |
| PyTorch | 2.10.0+cu128 | the exact wheel built on 2.11 loads without recompilation; 123 applicable Loom tests pass | [native-wheel gate](results/h20-native-wheel-clean-install-20260723.json) |
| PyTorch | 2.11.0+cu130 | clean wheel install, current stream, `torch.compile`, FakeTensor/opcheck, and CUDA Graph replay | [native-wheel gate](results/h20-native-wheel-clean-install-20260723.json) |
| vLLM | 0.24.0 | clean wheel install and all 192 registered-adapter/operator tests | [native-wheel gate](results/h20-native-wheel-clean-install-20260723.json) |
| vLLM | 0.25.1 | clean install from the official wheel and all 192 registered-adapter/operator tests | [native-wheel gate](results/h20-native-wheel-clean-install-20260723.json) |

The current source revision adds greedy speculative verification after that
wheel was built. On the same H20 PyTorch 2.11 stack, both vLLM 0.24.0 and
0.25.1 pass the expanded 202-test suite, including the real rejection-sampler
hook. This source result is recorded in the
[speculative verifier evidence](results/h20-greedy-speculative-verify-20260723.json);
it does not turn the older 192-test artifact into a new wheel.

The 0.25.1 gate proves that the current adapters and CUDA paths execute against
the official vLLM wheel. It does not retroactively transfer the 0.24
model-level latency results to 0.25.1. A new engine benchmark is required before
making a 0.25.1 performance claim.

Python package metadata therefore requires or accepts:

```text
torch>=2.10,<2.12
vllm>=0.24,<0.26
```

Versions outside that interval are not supported. Loom's optional registration
functions also check the installed vLLM series before patching engine classes
or compiler tables.

## Current native-wheel boundary

The published Rust crates remain self-contained source distributions. The
first qualified Python artifact is
`loom_kernels-1.0.0a1-1cu131torch210sm90-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl`.
It is built only through `python/build_wheel.py` from a clean Git revision and
contains exactly:

- `libloom_cuda_bridge.so` — Rust contracts, borrowed safe dispatch, and the
  internal handwritten CUDA launch layer;
- `libloom_kernels_torch.so` — boxed LibTorch Stable ABI dispatcher.

`native.json` records their hashes, Git revision, CUDA 13.1 toolkit, SM90
target, bridge ABI, and PyTorch runtime range. Installed wheels load only this
package-local pair. `PYTHONPATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and an external dispatcher
override were absent from every clean gate.

The wheel is Python-ABI-independent (`py3-none`) because neither native library
uses the CPython C API. Its platform tag remains the conservative
`linux_x86_64`; auditwheel 6.7 found a `manylinux_2_34_x86_64` symbol floor,
but Loom does not claim an earlier manylinux baseline. H20 runtime validation
currently covers Python 3.11 only.

The artifact is not published to PyPI or a GitHub release. This is a qualified
build/install boundary, not a claim that `pip install loom-kernels` can fetch a
native wheel from a public index.

## Current Stable ABI boundary

PyTorch documents a [LibTorch Stable ABI](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/libtorch_stable_abi.html)
and stable registration APIs for PyTorch 2.10 and newer. Loom's single
production dispatcher now uses that boundary:

- all schemas use boxed Stable ABI registration;
- tensor metadata, allocations, pointers, device guards, and the current CUDA
  stream use stable headers or AOTI C shims;
- all eleven semantic operators continue into `loom-cuda-bridge`; the dispatcher
  has no ATen/c10 C++ symbol dependency and consumes no raw CUDA launch symbol;
- the public Python APIs and vLLM admission predicates reject tensors requiring
  gradients. No autograd kernel is advertised;
- the temporary Add+RMSNorm probe and the previous ATen dispatcher were deleted
  after the production migration passed.

`python/build_wheel.py` now automates the first CUDA/PyTorch/Python matrix row,
audits its ELF boundary, and rejects accidental source-only wheels. One exact
artifact passed fresh-venv gates on PyTorch 2.10/2.11 and vLLM 0.24/0.25.
Publishing that artifact remains a separate, explicit release action.

## What must be revalidated

| Change | Minimum gate |
| --- | --- |
| Rust contract or aliasing rule | CPU oracle, invalid-input tests, safe CUDA wrapper |
| CUDA kernel | edge shapes, representative shapes, external stream, CUDA Graph |
| PyTorch dispatcher | opcheck/FakeTensor, mutation schema, `torch.compile`, full GPU suite |
| vLLM minor release | official wheel import, all adapter tests, explicit fallback tests |
| Performance claim | named baseline, warmed samples, correctness first, provider-order reversal for engines |
| Binary wheel claim | clean install on every published Python/PyTorch/CUDA matrix entry |
