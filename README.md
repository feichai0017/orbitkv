Loom Kernels owns the narrow operator boundaries where fusion, layout-aware
execution, quantization, or fewer launches can improve a real inference path.
It is not an inference engine, tensor framework, or replacement for vendor
GEMM libraries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Loom is an alpha project. Engine integrations are opt-in and shape-gated;
> unsupported contracts fall back to the engine's native implementation.

## What Loom owns

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Contract | Dtypes, shapes, layouts, aliasing rules, capability queries, and invalid-input behavior |
| Reference | Deterministic CPU oracles used before accelerator timing |
| Execution | Safe Rust dispatch over a small C ABI and handwritten CUDA kernels |
| Integration | Current-stream PyTorch operators and narrow vLLM 0.24/0.25 registration points |
| Evidence | Reproducible correctness, named-baseline, CUDA Graph, and engine gates |

Dense, quantized, sparse, and grouped GEMM always stay with cuBLASLt, CUTLASS,
FlashInfer, or the engine-selected backend. Loom targets the memory-bound work,
layout/scheduling metadata, and useful fusion boundaries around that matrix
core; it will not implement a competing GEMM.

## Supported operator paths

| Family | Operators | Qualified boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normalization | RMSNorm · Add+RMSNorm · RMSNorm→dynamic FP8 | F32, FP16, BF16; PyTorch and vLLM IR coverage |
| MLP | split-half SiLU-and-Mul · SiLU-and-Mul→block FP8 | F32, FP16, BF16; opt-in vLLM activation paths |
| Position and KV | NeoX/interleaved RoPE + paged-KV write | packed QKV, NHD/HND cache views, current-stream PyTorch |
| Decode tail | greedy + sampled logprob · selected-token logprob + rank · Min-P | exact-token/rank gates and measured vLLM fallbacks |
| Attention | paged MQA/GQA decode · local split-K/LSE merge | native paged KV, GQA reuse, short shape-gated vLLM route |

The [operator catalog](docs/operator-catalog.md) separates `supported`, `next`,
`planned`, `profile-gated`, and `vendor-backed` work. Catalog membership alone
is never a performance claim.

## Next value program

K0.7's first native-wheel engineering gate is complete for Linux x86_64,
CUDA 13.1, SM90, Python 3.11, PyTorch 2.10/2.11, and vLLM 0.24/0.25. The
artifact is qualified but not published to a package index. The ordered
feature program now is:

| Order | Direction | First proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Speculative decoding support | batched verification metadata, deterministic accept/reject, token compaction, and a real draft/target engine win |
| 2 | FP8 KV-cache compression | lower cache bytes and a larger admitted context or batch size with quality and TPOT reported |
| 3 | Complete sampling tail | penalties, top-k/top-p, deterministic RNG, and top-k logprobs through one engine path |
| 4 | KV-cache movement and quantization plumbing | measured prefix/preemption movement plus scale/pack/layout work around unchanged vendor GEMM |
| 5 | MoE routing and movement | routing, histogram/prefix sum, permutation, and combine around vendor grouped GEMM |
| 6 | Minimal Rust decode proof | one zero-copy decode step over borrowed tensors and streams, without becoming an inference engine |

The detailed contracts and exit criteria live in the
[roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

    F -. gates .-> B
    F -. defines .-> P
```

Every framework operator follows this path. There is no Python/ctypes
implementation, unchecked dispatcher twin, direct C++-to-CUDA launch, or
layout-specific fallback inside Loom. PyTorch passes existing pointers,
physical storage spans, strides, and its current stream through the versioned
bridge through one LibTorch Stable ABI dispatcher targeting PyTorch 2.10;
Rust constructs checked borrowed views and selects the CUDA kernel. The backend
either accepts the exact contract or returns an error. Engine adapters decide
whether to call Loom before dispatch and retain the engine's native
implementation for unsupported semantics.

## Quick start

Use the backend-independent contracts from any Rust project:

```bash
cargo add loom-kernels@1.0.0-alpha.1
```

On a CUDA build host, add the safe GPU backend explicitly:

```bash
cargo add loom-cuda@1.0.0-alpha.1 --features cuda
```

The default workspace is dependency-light and does not require CUDA:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/feichai0017/loom-kernels.git
cd loom-kernels

cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo check --workspace --release
```

On an NVIDIA CUDA host, set the toolkit and target architecture explicitly:

```bash
CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-13.1 LOOM_CUDA_ARCHS=90 \
  cargo check -p loom-cuda --features cuda --release

CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-13.1 LOOM_CUDA_ARCHS=90 \
  cargo run -p loom-cuda --features cuda --release \
  --example rust_cuda_smoke

CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-13.1 LOOM_CUDA_ARCHS=90 \
  cargo bench -p loom-cuda --features cuda \
  --bench add_rms_norm -- \
  --dtype bf16 --rows 8 --hidden-size 4096
```

Build the native Python artifact from a clean Linux x86_64 checkout:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-wheel
.venv-wheel/bin/pip install \
  'setuptools>=80,<82' 'wheel>=0.45' build 'torch>=2.10,<2.12'

CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-13.1 LOOM_CUDA_ARCHS=90 \
  .venv-wheel/bin/python python/build_wheel.py \
  --cuda-home /usr/local/cuda-13.1 \
  --archs 90 \
  --wheel-dir dist

python3 -m venv .venv-loom
.venv-loom/bin/pip install \
  'dist/loom_kernels-1.0.0a1-1cu131torch210sm90-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl[test]'
```

The wheel contains exactly `libloom_cuda_bridge.so` and the boxed
`libloom_kernels_torch.so` Stable ABI dispatcher, plus a manifest binding the
Git revision, CUDA toolkit, SM targets, runtime range, and library hashes. A
source-only wheel is rejected. The installed package validates that manifest
and loads only its packaged libraries; no repository checkout or library-path
override is used.

See the [Python README](python/README.md) for binary and editable development
flows, direct calls, and the
[vLLM integration guide](docs/guides/vllm-ir-provider.md) for every opt-in and
fallback contract. The [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md) separates
source development, qualified framework versions, and the native-wheel
boundary.

## Evidence, not blanket claims

The table below is a compact view of qualified NVIDIA H20 results. Each link
opens the raw JSON artifact used for the claim.

| Path | Qualified result | Claim boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Greedy + sampled logprob](docs/results/h20-greedy-sample-logprobs-20260722.json) | `3.16–4.35×` operator ratio; `1.129–1.250×` real-engine batch-latency ratio | Pure greedy requests with raw `logprobs=0` |
| [Selected-token logprob + rank](docs/results/h20-selected-token-logprobs-20260722.json) | `2.77–3.78×` operator ratio; `1.044–1.125×` real-engine batch-latency ratio | vLLM still owns top-k/top-p, RNG, and selection |
| [Min-P filtering](docs/results/h20-min-p-filter-20260722.json) | `1.885×` at 128 rows and no tensor-sized probability/mask temporaries | Smaller batches fall back to vLLM |
| [RoPE + paged-KV write](docs/results/h20-rope-paged-kv-20260722.json) | `2.30–2.40×` dispatcher ratio for 1–512 tokens | Real-engine invocation is proven; end-to-end remains at parity |
| [Short paged decode](docs/results/h20-vllm-paged-decode-backend-20260722.json) | `1.154–2.374×` across all 24 admitted backend cases | FP16/BF16, Hq/Hkv 32/8, D128, context ≤32; other shapes use FA3 |
| [Local split-K paged decode](docs/results/h20-paged-decode-split-k-20260722.json) | `1.14–6.22×` versus legacy Loom | Improves the Rust/CUDA backend; FA3 remains the long-context engine fallback |
| [LibTorch Stable ABI dispatcher](docs/results/h20-libtorch-stable-abi-20260723.json) | Same `.so`: 192 tests on PyTorch 2.11 with each vLLM minor; 123 applicable tests on PyTorch 2.10 | Binary compatibility result only; native wheels and broader PyTorch versions remain unclaimed |
| [Native matrix wheel](docs/results/h20-native-wheel-clean-install-20260723.json) | Same wheel: 192 tests with each vLLM minor; 123 applicable tests on PyTorch 2.10 | Linux x86_64, CUDA 13.1, SM90, Python 3.11; artifact is not published |

> [!NOTE]
> A fast kernel is not automatically a faster model. Loom records operator,

> Only artifacts under [`docs/results`](docs/results/README.md) support measured
